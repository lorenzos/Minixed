**Minixed** is a minimal but nice-looking PHP directory indexer.  
You can see it as a replacement for the Apache `mod_autoindex`.

> *첞ow does it look?* Like [**this**](http://www.lorenzostanco.com/minixed_demo/).  
> *첟 don't like it.* You are a CSS master, right? Good, you know what to do.

How to use
----------

Just drop the [**`index.php`**](https://github.com/lorenzos/Minixed/blob/master/index.php) 
script in the same directory that contains files you want to index.

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorenzos/Minixed/master/index.php

> *첮eally? One single file?* Yes, really. Glad you asked.  
> *첟f so, where are icon files?* They are hard coded into the source, thanks Base-64.  
> *첳as it really necessary?* I don't know, I just loved the idea you need only one file.

If you want Minixed to work also in subfolders, you need to place a copy of `index.php`
in every directory you want to index.

Configuration
-------------

The script works well out-of-the-box, and generally you want to leave it as it is.

However if you have some particular needs, there are some PHP variables placed 
in the first lines of `index.php` you can edit.

You can change the page title (and subtitle) providing strings that can contains
some placeholders that will be *parsed* at runtime:

	$title = 'Index of {{path}}';
	$subtitle = '{{files}} objects in this folder, {{size}} total'; // Empty to disable
	
You can tell the script how to build the files list using:
	
	$showParent = false; // Display a (parent directory) link
	$showDirectories = true;
	$showHiddenFiles = false; // Display files starting with "." too
	
And how that list should look:

	$alignment = 'left'; // You can use 'left' or 'center'
	$showIcons = true;
	$dateFormat = 'dd/mm/yyyy HH:ii'; // Used in date() function
	$sizeDecimals = 1;
	
Finally, you can customize the content of the meta-tag "robots" 
if you want to give some search engine hints:

	$robots = 'noindex, nofollow'; // Avoid robots by default
	
Of course, if PHP is a friend of yours you can easily
understand the whole script source code, so the only limit to
customization is your imagination.
